### Hexagonal Architecture / Ports and Adapters

#### Hexagonal Architecture is an architectural style that moves programmer’s focus from conceptual layers to a distinction between the software’s inside and outside parts.

### .center[Drawbacks of the Multi-Tier Architecture]

.center[![](treasure-small.png)]

* Where is the application core?
* Businesslogic can be find in every layer
* It can be hard to implement tests

##### The outside part:
* UI
* database
* messaging
* ...

##### The inside part:
* core domain

### .center[Principles]

* The inside part knows nothing about the outside part
* You should be able to use any adapter that fits a given port
* No use case or domain logic goes to the outside part
